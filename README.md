# Chat App
This is a prototype application that uses ChatGPT and DALL-E2 to achieve text-to-image prompt enhancement and uses ChatGPT to plan a schedule.

## Remarks
- You shall need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to connect the prototype to ChatGPT and DALL-E2. Please create one in an OpenAI account and input it to the navbar while using.
